## General Information
- This project helps users quickly generate meeting transcripts and concise notes.
- Solves the problem of manual note-taking and difficulty in searching past meetings.
- The purpose is to increase productivity by automating transcription, summarization, and semantic search.
- Developed as a local, private, and easy-to-use personal assistant.


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11

- Faster-Whisper– for transcription

- Facebook BART– for summarization

- FAISS– for semantic search

- Streamlit– frontend interface

- Docker – for containerized deployment


## Features
- Transcribe audio meetings to text locally

- Generate automated summaries from transcripts

- Perform semantic search over recent meeting summaries

- Upload audio and view results in a Streamlit app

- Docker deployment for local or cloud usage



## Setup
1. Clone & Install-

    git clone <repo_url>
    cd <repo_name>
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate virtual environment
    source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the app-

    streamlit run app.py

3. Docker Deployment-

    docker build -t meeting-assistant .
    docker run -p 8501:8501 meeting-assistant


## Usage
1.Open the Streamlit app in your browser.

2.Upload your meeting audio file.

3.View the transcript and autogenerated summary.

4.Search past summaries using semantic search for quick reference.



## Room for Improvement
- Add fine-tuned summarization models for more accurate notes.
- Improve semantic search for large datasets.
- Enhance UI/UX with search filters and history tracking.

To do:
- Support longer audio uploads with chunking
- Add real-time transcription capability


## Acknowledgements
